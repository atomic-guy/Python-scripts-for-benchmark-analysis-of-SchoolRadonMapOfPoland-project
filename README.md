## Description
**The repository contains python3.7 scripts used to analyze the results of the benchmark task carried out by high school students in Poland as part of the School Radon Map of Poland project. The results of the task were sent in a prepared Excel file template. Scripts are used to read data from Excel files, statistical analysis of the participants of the task, detailed analysis of the results, comparison with reference results, search for groups of students with the best results, visualize data on graphs.**

## The School Radon Map of Poland
 ...is an educational project for secondary schools implemented by the Atomic Forum Foundation. As part of the project, schools performed a benchmark task titled "Assessment of Radon Concentration". The task was to analyze the microscopic photos of the CR-39 radon detector plates using the ImageJ program, and then, using the ready or self-made calibration, to assess the radon concentration in the rooms where the measurement was performed.
